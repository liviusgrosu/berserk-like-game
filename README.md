The inverse kinemetics of each leg is calculated using the FABRIK algorithm. In general the starting point (root or leaf point) is placed
at its ancor point (root socket or goal point respectively), then the following points position is calculated based off a vector between itself and 
the previous point. The process goes from leaf to root and vice versa. The more iterations here are, the more accurate the arm placement to the
goal will be.
